- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stodirstukos !
- 👀 I’m (very) interested in Dwarf Fortress, hence the name (it's Dwarvish for "Volcanorazors" aka obsidian), which is why...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code Lua so I can create complex modifications for the game via DFHack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DFHack itself by contributing scripts and things once I know what I'm doing.
- 📫 How to reach me... I'm not sure yet! Here for starters, depending on how that works. I might join whatever discords there are when I find them.
